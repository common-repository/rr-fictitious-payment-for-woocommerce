Adds a fictitious payment gateway to WooCommerce available only for administrators to test or verify the checkout process

== Description ==

Adds a fictiv payment gateway to WooCommerce available only for administrators to test or verify the checkout process.

Can be used safely in a real-world environment (because this feature is only available to the administrator).
Useful for testing the order process as a whole (when setting up the store or other plugins) or for orders placed by phone/email and paid live.
With RR Fictitious Payment for WooCommerce, the payment is considered to be made (unlike payments by transfer or check which place the order "pending payment").

* The plugin can only be activated if WooCommerce is installed and activated.
* The payment method can be enabled / disabled within WooCommerce: WooCommerce> Settings> Payments
* The payment method is visible and accessible only to administrators.
* Orders paid via RR Fictitious Payment are considered paid, with status "In progress" (wc-processing, which triggers the linked operations: emptying the basket, sending mail, reducing the stock, etc.).
* The plugin settings page allows you to define a text "Instructions" and to configure if these instructions are to be added on the thank you page and / or emails.
* An internal traceability note is added to the order: Order placed by admin "xxx" and paid via RR Fictitious Payment.

** Supported Languages **
